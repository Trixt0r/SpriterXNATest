SpriterXNATest
==============

A brief test of ikvm and my spriter library for java.

To use the spriter plugin in your C# project, just add the spriter.dll and the IKVM.OpenJDK.Core.dll to your library path.
The loader and drawer are XNA specific, but it should not be that hard to port them to another backend.
